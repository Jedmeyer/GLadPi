Welcome to GLaDPi, a randomized blurter that 
yells at whoever walks by!

Place Files you would like the Blurter to yell
inside of the file labelled "Apeture". The program will autodetect it.
It will then yell it, and stay quiet for 10 seconds.


The PIR Sensor GPIO Pin must be hardcoded:
See "int pinNum" (L113) to set yours before 
compilation. 


A speaker and Power Supply must also 
be connected for obvious reasons.
